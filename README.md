### Developer when awake, researcher all the time.

_I love simple and fast code. And to pretend AIs enjoy playing video games as much as I do._

I work as a C/C++ and Python developer and I'm also a [Deep Reinforcement Learning researcher](https://paulobruno.github.io/publications/). I always like to try novel approaches and find unusual ways to solve a problem, looking beyond the trivial solutions everybody knows. As such, some of my results are very very _awful_. Some others are very very _exciting_. And I think that's beautiful. 

Also - and this is an important warning - don't expect me to create dozens of classes with intricate multi-hierarchy objects. My goal is to write clean, simple, and, of course, fast code. However, I don't see performance as the main target, but rather as the result of treating the computer with care ([data-oriented design](http://gamesfromwithin.com/data-oriented-design), count on me).
