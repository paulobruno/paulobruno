### I love simple and fast code. And to pretend AIs enjoy playing video games as much as I do.

I'm a _PhD student_ in Computer Science at [GSSI](https://www.gssi.it/) working on [Conversational Explainable AI](https://paulobruno.github.io/publications/). I always like to try novel approaches and find unusual ways to solve a problem, looking beyond the immediate solutions. As such, some of my results are very very _awful_. Some others are very very _exciting_. And I think that's beautiful. 

#### I'm usually programming in one of these languages
